''In the your-age version , the phrase `` for someone your age '' was added to the end of the question to encourage people to recalibrate their responses based on age , and in the 20-year-old version , the phrase `` for a 20-year-old '' was added to minimize recalibration .A total of 1015 subjects responded to the rating task ( 98 % response rate ) .Health ratings varied significantly across versions , with subjects responding to the 20-year-old version reporting lower health ( mean rating 66 of 100 ) than those responding to the your-age version ( mean rating of 73 , P < 0.001 ) or the perfect health version ( mean rating of 73 , P < 0.001 ) .This result suggests that subjects interpret perfect health to mean `` perfect health for someone your age . ''However , additional analysis showed that the interpretation of the phrase perfect health lies somewhere between the other 2 versions .For example , responses to the perfect health and 20-year-old versions varied significantly by respondent age ( both P 's < 0.075 ) , whereas responses to the your-age scale did not ( P = 0.8 ) .The phrase `` perfect health '' is ambiguous , causing some people to recalibrate their responses based on their age .Such ambiguity threatens the validity of common subjective health ratings , thereby reducing the comparability of responses across people of different ages or different circumstances .\"\n",
